<!-- AJAX is about updating parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

AJAX = Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.

AJAX is a technique for creating fast and dynamic web pages.

AJAX allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. This means that it is possible to update parts of a web page, without reloading the whole page.

Classic web pages, (which do not use AJAX) must reload the entire page if the content should change.

AJAX is based on internet standards, and uses a combination of:

XMLHttpRequest object (to exchange data asynchronously with a server)
JavaScript/DOM (to display/interact with the information)
CSS (to style the data)
XML (often used as the format for transferring data)-->




<!-- Create an XMLHttpRequest object
Create the function to be executed when the server response is ready
Send the request off to a PHP file (gethint.php) on the server -->

<!-- A callback function is a function that has to be executed after another function is executed -->
